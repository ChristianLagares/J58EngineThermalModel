# J58 Engine Thermal Analysis

## Introduction

As part of the INME 4707 course at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, a group is required to model a turbojet engine. We chose to model the iconic P&W J58 Engine. As a caveat, we will study the engine at flight velocity below Mach 2.2 as we require the engine in a turbojet configuration.
