<h2>1 December 2005: Infrastructure Upgrades</h2>
<p>Some of you may have noticed something a little different about many of the pages here at www.sr-71.org over the past couple of months.
First, you may have noticed a line of text stating valid XHTML, CSS, and RSS, followed by a "page rendered in n-seconds" line at the bottom of each page.
This tells you two things: First, it says that the web site is going to have valid markup, as proposed by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>.
It also says that this web site is fully dynamic, meaning each page is rendered by a custom, server-side script. Starting at the beginning of October 2005,
this project was launched to upgrade the infrastructure of the web site. This is a very daunting project, and yet there are few outward changes, or new
content for that matter. Sounds like a lot of work for nothing, why am I doing it?</p>

<p>There are several reasons why it is absolutely necessary that I do this. First, the web site is becoming too large to manage static pages. If I want
to change formatting or design, it is a nightmare. The site's design has not been changed since April 2002, and took a month to apply the design to every
page then. That was nearly three years ago, imagine today what time it would take to do that. With a fully dynamic site (based on a PHP backend) and help
from cascading style sheets, I can change the site's design in seconds. Secondly, the markup of this site has been jacked up for years. In the old days,
I used Microsoft FrontPage 2000 to maintain this site. Now, I have a hard time knocking this software, even though other developers cringe at mention of
it. It has actually worked out well for me, and produces pretty clean HTML code despite its invalid heritage and bad rap. Today, more than 2/3 of the site
has been converted over to the new infrastructure and this would not be possible without a lot of the markup being correct to begin with.</p>

<p>I am working hard to deliver a fully XHTML 1.0 Strict (currently Transitional) web site. The site is now entirely coded by hand, and it is still very
tedious upgrading the markup for each page. When this project is completed next spring, maintaining this web site will be a snap, and doing things like
adding new image galleries will take minutes instead of hours, as this too is all rendered by the new backend. In addition to the new markup, there is
also an RSS feed that you may subscribe to for instant access to all changes on this site. I will not be updating this feed until I start adding new content
again, so be sure to check back in the spring when the new content starts rolling out again.</p>

<p>Also, I have a favor to ask. If anyone finds a page that has invalid markup, but also claims to be valid, <a href="../contact/index.html">let me know</a>. Also, I am
aware that <strong>the message board is broken</strong>. I will fix it as soon as I can, but I am focused on getting more of the new infrastructure up as
soon as possible.</p>

<h2>1 February 2004: Major Update</h2>

<p>This release represents about seven months of work. The change log is way too long and I probably will forget something, but here are some of the new
features:</p>

<p>Overhauled image galleries (Including new photos):</p>

<p>
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17956/index.html">SR-71B #61-7956</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/06935/index.html">YF-12A #60-6935</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17968/index.html">SR-71A #61-7968</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17972/index.html">SR-71A #61-7972</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17976/index.html">SR-71A #61-7976</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/d-21/index.html">D-21 Drone</a>,
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/startercart/index.html">Starter Carts</a>, and
<a href="../photogallery/blackbird/j-58/index.html">J-58s</a>.
</p>

<p>New image galleries:</p>

<p><a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17961/index.html">SR-71A #61-7961</a>, <a href="../photogallery/blackbird/17964/index.html">SR-71A #61-7964</a></p>

<p>New <a href="../blackbird/wallpaper/index.html">Blackbird Wallpaper</a></p>

<p>It is my goal to increase the size of all photos on this site to 900 x 600 and to optimize the JPEGs. This will be apparent in the new and overhauled galleries.
In the future, I would like to redo the rest.</p>

<p>During July 2003, I went to the opening of the Kettering Gallery at the USAF Museum and Airventure 2003. In December, I went to the grand opening of the Steven
F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA. Getting some of these photos on the site will be my next target. Look for more in the <a href="../museums/index.html">Museums</a> section
in the future.</p>

<h2>20 August 2002:</h2>
<p>Former Lockheed Test Pilot Louis Wellington &quot;Lou&quot; Schalk died Friday, August 16, 2002. He was 76.</p>

<p>Schalk joined Lockheed Aircraft Corporation as an engineering test pilot in 1957, following U.S. Air Force service as a fighter pilot and test pilot. In 1959
he was selected as Kelly Johnson's chief test pilot for the then Skunk Works. He went on to make aviation history on April 16, 1962, when he became the first person
to fly the A-12 Blackbird and later the YF-12. During his aviation career, he flew more than 70 different aircraft types, including such aircraft as the F-100, F-101
and Lockheed F-104.</p>

<p>Accolades received over the years include the Society of Experimental Test Pilots' (SETP) &quot;Iven C. Kincheloe Award&quot; (it's top honor) in 1964, and he
became an SETP Associate Fellow in 1967. In 1999 he joined Neil Armstrong, Chuck Yeager, Pete Knight, Jimmy Doolittle and many other aviation greats when he was honored
at the City of Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of Honor. In April 2002, he was inducted into the Blackbird Laurels Fraternity.</p>

<p>A native of Alden, Iowa, Schalk was born on May 29, 1926. He is survived by his wife, Louise, who resides in Fairfax, Va.</p>
