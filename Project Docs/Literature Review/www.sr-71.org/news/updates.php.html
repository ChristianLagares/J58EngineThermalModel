<p>9 December 1999: Worked on the homepage a little. I created the &quot;Make SR-71 Online Your Start Page&quot; page. I also updated the news and started
working on some other problems that I found.</p>

<p>1 December 1999: The new homepage is now up! It took a month to get that thing tweaked out, but it is now ready to serve as the page for www.sr-71.org.
Updated the Aircraft of the Month Page, the introduction page, and updates. Currently working with a former SR-71 mechanic on an interview page.</p>

<p>18 November 1999: Updated the start page by making the background music compatible with Netscape.</p>

<p>12 November 1999: Updated the starting page by adding a link to my new site at www.fs2000.itgo.com.</p>

<p>24 October 1999: I updated the Blackbird News page and the Copyright Information Page. Also made a couple minor changes to some other pages.</p>

<p>23 October 1999: Worked on some of the format throughout the site. Updated the Blackbird Image Gallery. Also, I worked on the Copyright Information Page.</p>

<p>21 October 1999: I am back on the project. Now that things have begun to calm down, there will be some updates here at www.SR-71.org. I am planning to add some more photos
to the aircraft image gallery soon. We are now rated with RSAC.</p>

<p>6 October 1999: I have been extremely busy lately and I have not been able to work on the site at all not to mention I am in the process of creating a new site for
Flight Simulator 2000 that will launch in November under the SR-71 Online Productions name. As for this site, I am in the process of replying mail so if you send/sent
mail to me, you will get a reply soon.</p>

<p>10 September 1999: Updated several of the main pages with minor corrections that are not really noticeable. I updated the Blackbird Image Gallery, and added a link to
the Blackbird Links Page.</p>

<p>2 September 1999:&nbsp; I scanned some pictures from my trips to the USAF Museum, so therefore I created the USAF Museum Page. This page will be updated with more
pictures when I am able to do so. I updated the introduction page and the news page. I changed the aircraft of the month for September. Worked on the photo archive 
and added an F-16 photo and an F-117 photo. I added 4 photos to the Blackbird Photo Archive. I created an aviation links page that can be found on the Other Military
Aircraft Home Page. I modified the Blackbird Links page.</p>

<p>20 August 1999: Although I have not had a lot of time lately to work on the site, I have been making a few changes. I have been adding several photos to the
aircraft image gallery. Soon, the gallery may have commercial airliners also. I am trying to work on the KC-135Q page, I have info, but no time to work on the page.</p>

<p>31 July 1999: All of the photos from the trip are now up. They can be viewed at the Blackbird Image Gallery. I am currently working on the Aircraft Image Gallery. 
Soon, there will be a Blackbird News page and a D-21 locations page.</p>

<p>23 July 1999: Started to scan images from my trip to California. Added 3 photos to the Blackbird Photo Gallery. I also added another J58 picture with can be
viewed from the J58 page. I am working on a new version of the homepage that will be up as soon as I get Microsoft FrontPage 2000. I am working on adding about
20-30 new pictures to the Blackbird Photo Gallery alone, not to mention the other photos that I have collected of other aircraft. Don't bother reading the Blackbird
Experience page until I say that I have updated it. It is much different and there are more things to say, MANY MORE. The sitemap needs to be worked on a little so
please do not use it to view this site.</p>

<p>5 July 1999: I have been working on this site a little since the last report. I have mainly been working on a friend of mine's site. Hopefully, someday, I will have
all of the midi files alphabetized and all of the favorite links managed in a similar fashion. I have been working on a thumbnail page for the blackbird photo
gallery that I hope to have done in the near future. I am trying to concentrate on my other pages and let the Blackbird Archive go for a little while. I am thinking
of having a random photo gallery for other aircraft that would specifically target the XB-70, F-117A, B-52, B-2, F-22, and YF-23. I will be going on a trip to California
in the middle of July so there will be no updates until I return. I am going to Edwards Air Force Base and to Dryden Flight Research Center. I am also going to go to
Blackbird Air Park. I hope that I can get good photos of all aircraft that I see on the trip. When I return I hope to have many new photos in the photo archive.</p>

<p>26 June 1999: I am taking a break from this site for awhile so there will be no new stuff released for quite some time. You can still contact me at my regular e-mail
address, I will get back with you as soon as possible.</p>
