Most important of these is the SR-71. The info you provided is outstanding. All on one website. All the books you mention I own. Plus some more that are not specific to the SR-71, but deal with recon assets.

To think the technology within the SR-71, is still basically unmatched by even today's modern aircraft, is a tribute to the engineers who worked on the project more than thirty years ago. These amazing aircraft are not miricales ... we just decided to make them. Long live the Sr-71!</td></tr>
