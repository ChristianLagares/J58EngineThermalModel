<tr><th>Comments:</th><td>Hi, I'm a freshman in highschool and I had to pick a topic for a history project due in April. I decided to do it on the SR-71 Blackbird because about 1 year ago I went along with my brother on one of his Boy Scout trips to this aircraft hanger. I thought it would be really cool to look at all those planes plus I needed a reason to get out of the house. ;) We saw the Blackbird and were able to walk under it and touch the smooth, black exterior. We were also allowed to look inside the cockpit and at the controls. I was hooked. I could imagine myself flying this plane at Mach 3 80,000 ft in the air. It was an awesome experience. So I decided to do my history project on this aircraft and your site has helped me so much! The timeline was awesome and especially the SR-71 Manual book. It gives you a real insight on how this aircraft works. Thanks so much for making this site! It helped ALOT!! :)</td></tr>

<tr><th>Comments:</th><td>I'm Larry Ditler (DR, operating Initials), I was stationed at Beale AFB, in the GCA, from Aug 66 until Sep 67. A few notes of interest:  When I first arrived at BAB, the Blackbird was still experimental. When they went operational, they had a big Parade and Ceremony where they gave all of the pilots &quot;Astronaut Wings!&quot; The &quot;SR&quot; was really an easy ACFT to work on Precision Radar, we just started the Final Approach farther out!  The T38 flew chase on the SR. But, the SR was so fast, that if the T38 wasn't halfway through his turn from Base-leg to Final when the SR71 released his brakes for Takeoff, the T38 could NOT catch-up!  On the Other hand, if the T38 wasn't inside 3 NM from the End of Runway on Final Approach when the SR71 was 14 NM out, we had to instruct the T38 to execute a Missed Approach, because he couldn't land &amp; clear the runway before the SR71 would overtake him.... It was that FAST!  Also, after finishing a GCA Approach we would open the door of the GCA and tell the pilot &quot;Good Chute,&quot; because if he didn't have one, he was going to engage the barrier!  GREAT Site!!!  Thanks for the Memories! </td></tr>
