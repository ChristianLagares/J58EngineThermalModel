<p>Welcome to the Blackbird Archive: One of the best resources on the Internet for information, photos, and diagrams 
pertaining to the A-12, YF-12, SR-71, and D-21. This archive contains history and specifications on all Blackbird 
variants and most other associated aspects. Be sure to check back in the future because information is being 
added regularly. If you have any information or personal stories of your involvement with any of the related 
programs, please send these items in or add them to the <a href="../about/guestbook.php.html">guest book</a>; comments are always welcome!</p>

<h2><a href="introduction.php.html">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Blackbird is one of the most magnificent military jets ever developed. People have been fascinated with
the aircraft for decades, and not only because of the aircraft's capabilities. The aircraft has played an important
military role in international conflicts for nearly thirty years.</p>

<h2 class="section">Blackbird Variant Background Information and History:</h2>

<div class="sections">

<a href="a-12/index.html"><img src="06932_small.jpg" alt="A-12 Blackbird (Lockheed Photo)" title="A-12 Blackbird (Lockheed Photo)" width="100" height="66" /></a>
<div class="item"><div class="prop"></div>
<h2><a href="a-12/index.html">A-12 Blackbird</a></h2>
<p>The A-12 is the first of all Blackbird Variants. First flown in 1962, it had a very short career,
and was retired in 1968. The A-12s sat in storage for over twenty years in Palmdale before being
transported to museums around the country.</p>
<div class="clear"></div></div>

<a href="yf-12/index.html"><img src="06935_small.jpg" alt="YF-12 Blackbird (NASA Photo)" title="YF-12 Blackbird (NASA Photo)" width="100" height="66" /></a>
<div class="item"><div class="prop"></div>
<h2><a href="yf-12/index.html">YF-12A Blackbird</a></h2>
<p>The YF-12A is a prototype for a proposed Mach 3+ interceptor/bomber. Only three were originally
built and only one remains today. The YF-12A program was cancelled in the mid-1960s for budgetary reasons.
However, the aircraft went on to serve NASA before its eventual retirement in 1979.</p>
<div class="clear"></div></div>

<a href="sr-71/index.html"><img src="17971_index.jpg" alt="SR-71 Blackbird (Paul Kucher Collection)" title="SR-71 Blackbird (Paul Kucher Collection)" width="100" height="66" /></a>
<div class="item"><div class="prop"></div>
<h2><a href="sr-71/index.html">SR-71 Blackbird</a></h2>
<p>Following the development of the A-12 came the SR-71, an improved platform for reconnaissance.
The capabilities of the SR-71 versus the A-12 have been debated many times. Each of these aircraft
served different purposes and regardless which is better, the SR-71 is still a magnificent aircraft.</p>
<div class="clear"></div></div>

<a href="m-21.php.html"><img src="06940_index.jpg" alt="M-21 Blackbird (Lockheed Photo)" title="M-21 Blackbird (Lockheed Photo)" width="100" height="66" /></a>
<div class="item"><div class="prop"></div>
<h2><a href="m-21.php.html">M-21 Blackbird</a></h2>
<p>Although the M-21 looks like an A-12, it was not modified from one. After A-12 #60-6939 was built,
two M-21s were built. These aircraft had two cockpits: one for a Pilot and one for a Launch Control Officer.
Due to the fatal accident with aircraft #60-6941, the M-21/D-21 program was cancelled.</p>
<div class="clear"></div></div>

<a href="d-21.php.html"><img class="image_page" src="d-21_index.jpg" alt="D-21 Drone (Lockheed Photo)" title="D-21 Drone (Lockheed Photo)" width="100" height="66" /></a>
<div class="item"><div class="prop"></div>
<h2><a href="d-21.php.html">D-21 Drone</a></h2>
<p>Due to the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States restricting the use of manned
vehicles over the Soviet landmass, this unmanned aircraft was developed. The drone was carried
and launched by two A-12-like modified aircraft and a number of B-52Hs.</p>

<h2 class="section">Blackbird Images and Video:</h2>

<h2><a href="diagrams/index.html">Blackbird Diagrams Gallery</a></h2>
<p>This archive consists of NASA and USAF diagrams of the different variants of the Blackbird. These diagrams
include side-sectionals, component breakdowns with labels, and procedures. Be sure to check the SR-71 Flight
Manual for more diagrams as well.</p>

<h2><a href="events/index.html">Blackbird Events Gallery</a></h2>
<p>Blackbird events are a way for former crews and personnel to discuss and answer questions about the airplane they
love, and to interact with fans and buffs nationwide. Check here for photos from attended events.</p>

<h2><a href="../photogallery/blackbird/index.html">Blackbird Image Gallery</a></h2>
<p>This image archive is perhaps the largest collection of Blackbird images anywhere today. There are 
currently over 850 images in this gallery, including images of the Blackbird airframes and other associated 
items that kept the SR-71 operational.</p>

<h2><a href="movies/index.html">Blackbird Movie Gallery</a></h2>
<p>This is an archive of NASA movie clips of the Blackbird in flight. These clips are in MPEG and QuickTime format.
Be sure to update your computer's media player before viewing this section.</p>

<h2><a href="patches/index.html">Blackbird Patches</a></h2>
<p>Patch collecting is a hobby of many Blackbird fans. This archive contains images of some of the more memorable
patches associated with the different programs. All patches in this section are available for purchase in aviation
gift stores around the country.</p>

<h2><a href="wallpaper/index.html">Blackbird Wallpaper</a></h2>
<p>Let the Blackbird adorn your computer screen with desktop wallpapers made from some of the best photos in the Paul
Kucher Collection. The wallpapers come in two available sizes.</p>

<h2 class="section">Blackbird Equipment Information:</h2>

<h2><a href="j-58/index.html">J58 (JT11D-20A) Engine</a></h2>
<p>The J58 powered nearly all of the Blackbirds. Only one aircraft (A-12 #60-6927) used the J75 engine throughout
its entire career. The J58 is the first engine designed to operate for lengthy periods in afterburner, and it
is the first engine to be flight-qualified at Mach 3 for the Air Force.</p>

<h2 class="section">Blackbird Support Information:</h2>

<h2><a href="startercart.php.html">Starter Cart</a></h2>
<p>Without the starter carts, the Blackbird would not be startable. These units were placed under the nacelles
of each engine during startup and were used to spool the engines to 3200 RPM before a shot of TEB was used
to ignite the engine. There are two types of carts: one equipped with twin-Buick engines and one with twin-Chevys.</p>

<h2><a href="simulator.php.html">SR-71 Simulator</a></h2>
<p>The SR-71 Simulator is a unique piece of hardware used to train every crew member. Complete with both a Pilot
and an RSO cockpit, the SR-71 simulator's instrument panels are identical to those in the real aircraft.
The simulator is now at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards AFB, CA. This section includes background
information about the simulator and photos.</p>

<h2 class="section">Other Resources:</h2>

<h2><a href="acronyms.php.html">Acronyms</a></h2>

useful when reading other related resources as well.</p>

<h2><a href="flighthours.php.html">Blackbird Flight Hours</a></h2>
<p>This flight hours list is the most accurate compiled to date, even more so than any book that you may read.
However, some data has not yet surfaced for the flight hours of a few airframes that have been unaccounted for.</p>

<h2><a href="logs/index.html">Blackbird Flight Logs</a></h2>
<p>The last four active SR-71s (#956, #967, #971, and #980) have been grounded permanently and will soon be
transported to museums. Peter Merlin of NASA Dryden Flight Research Center has compiled a complete list of
flights for these aircraft with NASA. This information includes a description of the flight as well as speeds
and altitudes reached.</p>

<h2><a href="records.php.html">Blackbird Records</a></h2>
<p>The YF-12A and SR-71 set several speed and altitude records in the 1960s and 70s. In addition, SR-71A
#61-7972 set several speed records over recognized courses during its final flight and retirement to the National
Air and Space Museum in March 1990. These records are still unbroken after 35 years and it seems that the
SR-71 will remain the fastest air-breathing aircraft for some time.</p>

<h2><a href="miscinfo.php.html">Miscellaneous Blackbird Information</a></h2>
<p>Merely a list of random facts about the Blackbird, here are some interesting tidbits about the aircraft and its
career.</p>

<h2>SR-71 Online Message Boards (Message Boards Currently Down)</h2>
