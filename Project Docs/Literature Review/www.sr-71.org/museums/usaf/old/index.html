<p><strong>Following construction of a couple new hangars, a name change, and a rebranding effort, the USAF Museum is no more, and this guide is now obsolete.
Be sure to check out the <a href="../index.html">new guide</a>, but the old guide is kept for historical and sentimental purposes. This is what the museum looked like
prior to 2003, and probably looked like this since the early 1990s when the Modern Flight Hangar was constructed (1988). Some of these aircraft are now gone
or restored since the museum upgrades, like how the B-47E and B-1A have been replaced with the RB-47H and B-1B, respectively. Additionally, some of these
aircraft may not be in the new museum for restoration purposes. Whatever the case may be, today's National Museum of the United States Air Force is like a
completely different museum, and deserves a completely new guide.</strong></p>

<p>Located near Dayton, OH at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, this is the world's oldest and largest military aircraft museum. This is the pinnacle of museums,
a must see for any enthusiast. The museum houses more than 300 aircraft and missiles. There are several galleries in the museum, including the Outdoor Air Park,
Early Years, Air Power, Modern Flight, Presidential, and Research and Development. As a tribute to this great museum, an online tour of nearly every aircraft
on display has been compiled here.</p>

<p>A virtual tour of this type would not be complete without some visuals of the actual museum. It is amazing how such large aircraft may be held in any
building. View the exterior and the non-gallery interior portions of the building here.</p>

<p>There are several aircraft displayed outdoors that have yet to find a home inside. Most aircraft outside are larger and consequently, there is no
room for these aircraft indoors. Thankfully, some of these aircraft found their way indoors when the Cold War Hangar was completed in 2003.</p>
